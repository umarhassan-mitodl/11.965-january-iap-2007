Descriptions of the in-class activities are collected here ({{% resource_link 9bf4f91d-9db7-9f5d-c1bf-ba24d48b0da2 "PDF" %}}); these were compiled from the {{% resource_link 37ce4cfb-a382-d3b9-c7ad-12575988b2a0 "lecture notes" %}}.

A final paper was also required: At the end of the course, students will prepare one paper, of up to 5 double-spaced pages, in which they will identify the most important lessons or knowledge gained from the course and how they intend to use these in their future professional work and/or development. This reflection paper will be a written individual work, but once the students finish it, they will be invited to share their conclusions with their peers and their instructors.
